  - Create a copy of file and then edit it, or
  - Edit the same file
   - [Do it on your own risk!]
   - Edit the photo according to your taste!
- Do same step as above for Low folder and keep again in mind that resolutions for High and Low are different!
- Now go to extracted base folder and click on "Pack" and you will get a "Resources" folder in "Work" folder
  - Copy the files which will be mostly same in all cases namely -> "IconResources.idx" , "PSIconsHighRes.dat" and "PSIconsLowRes.dat"
